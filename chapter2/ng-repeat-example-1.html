		<!-- There is no functional difference between the curly brace notation {{}} and ng-bind notation; both take the value from the controller and display it in the UI. Both of them also keep it data-bound and up to date, so if the value underneath changes, the UI will change automatically. 

		The advantage ng-bind has over the double-curly notation is that it takes AngularJS time to bootstrap and execute before it can find and replace all the double curly braces from the HTML. That means, for a portion of a second while the browser starts, you might see flash‐ ing double curly braces in the UI before AngularJS has the chance to kick in and replace them.-->
